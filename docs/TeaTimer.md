Added "TeaTimer" option by Fra4prg

<P>
With the top left button you can switch between Stop Watch (counting up) and Tea Timer, counting down from a preset time. Set the time with new buttons plus and minus, switch between setting Minutes/Hours/Seconds with the Set button.

<P>
When Tea Timer count down reaches zero then a melody is played to remember you to pull the tea bag out of your cup (or what else you were waiting for).

The melody is played again every minute until you press the clear button.
Time is flashing between red and orange, also the Icon flashes between cup and bag.  --> It's time to pull the tea bag out of your cup!

After 30 seconds of goodwill time the sum of time is shown,
