Added "Smart Sound" option ("HeliTimer") by Fra4prg
</P>
<P>
"Smart Sound" enables you to hear the number of minutes without having to look on the display.

The idea behind this is that human brain can identify the number of 3 beeps as triple without counting them even if they are very short and fast.
So up to 3 beeps are played slowly and preceeding triples are faster.
For every 10 minutes a sweep sound is preceeding.

A new top left button switches modes between [no sound] - [vibration + sound] - [only sound]
Some examples to show the sequence:
</P>
<PRE>
Minute  1: C5
Minute  2: C5-E5
Minute  3: C5-E5-G5
Minute  4: triple - C5
Minute  5: triple - C5-E5
...
Minute  9: triple - triple - C5-E5-G5
Minute 10: sweep
...
Minute 18: sweep - triple - triple - C5-E5
and so on...
</PRE>
<P>
As you can see this works well for short times up to 10 minutes then it gets weird...
</P>

The idea came up when I was flying model helicopters where I had to control the flight time due to small batteries and could not loose visual contact to my heli model.
</P>
<P>
So I made a small Arduino based timer called HeliTimer.

<P>
But this function fits perfect to the T-watch :-)
